Amber Garage is a Silicon Valley based creative art &amp; tech studio. We love photography, nature, new media art, and robotics. 
As artists, we're creating our own art language to bridge the gap between virtual world and reality.
As photographers, we're exploring a solution to put our camera anytime anywhere on the planet to capture the beauty of our beloved world. 
As roboticist, we're thinking how robotics technology can revolutionize the process of creative works. 


We created <a href="https://skywand.com" target="_blank">Skywand</a> as a new art media to bridge the virtual world and the real world, which enables awesome creative projects that people could never imagine before. All our creative projects will be based on Skywand technologies: <a href="https://cityvr.com" target="_blank">The City VR Experience</a> and Airgraphy.
