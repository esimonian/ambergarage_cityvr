- question: How do I acquire a 3D model for the place I am planning to film?
  answer: |
    "You can either construct your own model by using photogrammetry, 
    which includes structured fly scanning and 3D reconstruction software 
    (like altizure.com). Or you can integrate with 3rd party vendor like Google Maps, 
    Apple Maps, or <a href="http://plwmodelworks.com">PLW</a> for an pre-constructed model. 
    Obviously they come with different price tags, and you should make your judgment based on 
    your requirement."
- question: Can I tune my trajectory during flights?
  answer: Yes, our iPad app, augmented reality application and Maya plugin all support modifying your camera path on spot.
- question: How fast can the drone move when program is controlling it?
  answer: You can push to the full limit of the drone. e.g., 15m/s for Inspire 1.
- question: Does wind affect the drone flight trajectory?
  answer: |
    Yes, calmer weather will give you a smoother shot. From our experiment, 
    when wind speed exceeds 15m/s, the shot of small quadcopter like Inspire 1 
    become unstable. But the production-level multirotors will have more stability.
- question: Is there a limit on the number of key frames?
  answer: In current release we do have a limit of 50 key frames. We are planning to raise this limit in future release.
