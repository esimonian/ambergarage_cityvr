        The City VR Experience is an immersive virtual reality experience that allows you to 
        discover new perspectives to look upon the world we live in like never have before.

        than just a 3D map. It enables you to travel through the streets like a giant, 
        observe architecture from up on high, zoom in to the ground or zoom out to the air, 
        change lighting and weather, and take snapshots of the most unique city views discovered 
        on your own.

    - question: What is the story behind City VR?
      answer: |
        "City VR is inspired by <a href="https://skywand.com" target="_blank">Skywand</a>, 
        Amber Garageâ€™s first artwork. Skywand allows anyone, including cinematographers and 
        those with zero drone experience, to create precise aerial filming plans in an intuitive 
        3D virtual interface and have actual drone executed subsequently. Skywand eliminates 
        technical barriers to achieve professional drone cinematography by automating the flight 
        process and arm visionary filmmakers with a power and intelligent partner. 
        The 3D models in City VR comes from a combination of Amber Garage's own aerial
        photogrammetry technology (data collected using Skywand mentioned above) and the 
        third party model provider <a href="http://plwmodelworks.com/">PLW</a>. "
